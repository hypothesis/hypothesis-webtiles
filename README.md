# Microsoft Band Webtile's for Hypothes.is

Seriously.

## Stream Tile

The one and only tile available at the moment. It grabs content
from the Hypothes.is Atom feed, and displays it on your
[Microsoft Band](http://microsoftband.com/). Neat.

### Building

It's no harder than zipping up the `stream` folder and renaming
the `.zip` file to `.webtile` file and getting that to your Band
connected phone--email, a link, whatever. Open the `.webtile` on
that device and it'll sync it to your Band. Pretty slick.
